This document serves as the "Source of Truth" for any AI agent or developer working on the Nova Scotia Invitational Beach Sprints Regatta website.

## Color Palette (Business DNA)

| Element | Hex Code | Usage |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Primary Blue** | `#00639B` | Main brand color, primary buttons, accents. |
| **Background / Surface** | `#F0F4F8` | Page background. |
| **Card Surface** | `#FFFFFF` | Cards and panels. |
| **Dark Neutral** | `#1A1C1E` | Main text. |
| **Muted Text** | `#43474E` | Secondary text. |
| **Hero Background** | `#EBF1F9` | Hero section background. |

## Typography

- **Font Family**: `Outfit` (Google Fonts)
- **Hierarchy**:
  - `H1`: 800-900 weight, tight letter-spacing (`-1.2px`), large scale.
  - `H2/H3`: Bold, clear contrast.
  - `Body`: Clean, legible Line-height (`1.5`).

## Design Principles

1.  **Coastal Energy**: Use gradients and subtle patterns (like nautical grids) to reflect the Atlantic character.
2.  **Premium Material 3**: High rounded corners (`24px` to `28px`), soft shadows, and clean flat surfaces.
3.  **Contrast**: Always ensure high legibility. Text on the Primary Blue background should be Pure White.
4.  **Information Hierarchy**: Essential info (Dates, Venue, Countdown) should be prominent and presented in "Fact Cards."

## Project Layout

- **Hero Section**: Centered single-column layout. High focus on the logo and primary CTA.
- **Quick Facts**: Dedicated section below the hero for density and clarity.
- **Partners**: Logos should be presented with a monochromatic (grayscale) base that restores to color on hover for a sophisticated look.
